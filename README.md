## Divercity
Divercity is a web application that helps you find gender-free bathrooms.
Gender-free bathrooms can provide a safer environment for transgender people or people that don't want to define their gender.

## Motivations
The idea of the project comes from a big problem that cities have nowadays, which is the separation of bathrooms by gender (Men/Women). Our aim is to increase the number of gender-free bathrooms, to which everybody can go to without the need of defining their gender.

## Code example
The following code snippet shows the way the application behaves whenever the user calls for the main view ("GET Request"):
```
if request.method == "GET":
        restrooms = []
        restroom = {}
        cursor = mongo.db.collection.find()
        for record in cursor:
            restrooms.append(record)
        return render_template("index.html", restrooms=restrooms, r=restroom)
```
## Installation
For the use of the application on your own PC we recommend you use a virtual environment, like [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io), for a safer installation of the needed libraries.
<br>
In order to deploy the application on a server, the easiest way is to do it through [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com). You can find a short cheatsheet for deploying apps on Heroku [here](https://github.com/AxelJunes/MLaaS/blob/master/heroku_cheatsheet.txt).

## Mode of use
The website has two views:
- The main view has a map that contains markers with all the gender-free bathrooms that are registered in the database. This view has two buttons: "Add a bathroom", which lets the user add a new bathroom to the application (with a form), and "Bathrooms near me", that checks which bathrooms are close to the user and zooms to the users position.
- The "About Divercity" view, which contains all the information about the application.
